Q1.

Q2. First of all, the titles are descriptive and generally concise. The first word is used to describe the main changement that has been committed such as merge, add, update and fix. Although the descriptions are clear, they do not exactly always follow the same sintax, in fact, a small amount of commits use uncommon key-words format or directly explain the changement being made in the commit, decreasing the quality of the commits. It is generally adviced to explicitely indicate the scope of the commit by adding a well describing word as the first term of the commit and then additional concise information. With taht been said, this is generally followed but could be implemented even more intensily.

Q3. The GitHub issues are almost always organized into 3 different categories:
    -Bugs: Issues that report crashes or unexpected behavior.
    -Questions: Issues seeking clarification or guidance.
    -Help/Feedback: Issues that share updates and versions, and invite users to provide feedback.
    We can also see that this organisation is very recent since only a few months ago these categories were not used.
    
Q4. Yes indeed, there are instructions for contributing to the OneSignal Android SDK project. These instructions can be found in the CONTRIBUTING.md and can be resumed in the following two concepts:
    1: For small bug fixes, create a fork and submit a pull request.
    2: For major changes, contact the team before doing anything.
    There are also specific instructions for when someone desires to submit a bug report:
    -Use a clear title.
    -Provide reproduction steps.
    -Describe your environment.
    -Include a stack trace if needed.
    -If possible and not too complicated to do, add an example project.

Q7. The release notes for the OneSignal Android SDK on GitHub are typically organized in reverse chronological order, with the most recent release displayed at the top. Each release is presented as a separate entry and includes information about the release version, release date, and notable changes or updates.
    Here is a typical structure of the release notes on the OneSignal Android SDK GitHub page:
   - Release Version and Date: The release version number and the date of the release are mentioned at the beginning of each entry. This helps users identify the specific release they are interested in.
   - Release Highlights: Following the version and date, there is usually a section that highlights the key changes or updates introduced in the release. This section provides a brief overview of the significant improvements, bug fixes, new features, or enhancements made to the SDK.
   - Detailed Changelog: After the release highlights, a detailed changelog is often provided. This section lists all the specific changes, bug fixes, and improvements made in the release. It may include information about resolved issues, added functionality, modified behavior, and any other relevant details.
   - Deprecated Features or Breaking Changes: If there are any deprecated features or breaking changes that users need to be aware of when upgrading to the new release, they are typically mentioned separately. This helps developers understand the potential impact of the update on their existing integrations.
   - Additional Information: Depending on the release, there might be additional information provided, such as installation instructions, usage guidelines, or any other relevant notes specific to that release.

By organizing the release notes in this manner, users can easily navigate through the different versions of the OneSignal Android SDK, understand the changes made in each release, and assess the impact of those changes on their projects.
