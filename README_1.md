Q1.
Q2. First of all, the titles are descriptive and generally concise. The first word is used to describe the main changement that has been committed such as merge, add, update and fix. Although the descriptions are clear, they do not exactly always follow the same sintax, in fact, a small amount of commits use uncommon key-words format or directly explain the changement being made in the commit, decreasing the quality of the commits. It is generally adviced to explicitely indicate the scope of the commit by adding a well describing word as the first term of the commit and then additional concise information. With taht been said, this is generally followed but could be implemented even more intensily.
