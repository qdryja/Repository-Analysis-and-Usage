Q3. The GitHub issues are almost always organized into 3 different categories:
    -Bugs: Issues that report crashes or unexpected behavior.
    -Questions: Issues seeking clarification or guidance.
    -Help/Feedback: Issues that share updates and versions, and invite users to provide feedback.
    We can also see that this organisation is very recent since only a few months ago these categories were not used.
