Q1.

Q2. First of all, the titles are descriptive and generally concise. The first word is used to describe the main changement that has been committed such as merge, add, update and fix. Although the descriptions are clear, they do not exactly always follow the same sintax, in fact, a small amount of commits use uncommon key-words format or directly explain the changement being made in the commit, decreasing the quality of the commits. It is generally adviced to explicitely indicate the scope of the commit by adding a well describing word as the first term of the commit and then additional concise information. With taht been said, this is generally followed but could be implemented even more intensily.

Q3. The GitHub issues are almost always organized into 3 different categories:
    -Bugs: Issues that report crashes or unexpected behavior.
    -Questions: Issues seeking clarification or guidance.
    -Help/Feedback: Issues that share updates and versions, and invite users to provide feedback.
    We can also see that this organisation is very recent since only a few months ago these categories were not used.
    
Q4. Yes indeed, there are instructions for contributing to the OneSignal Android SDK project. These instructions can be found in the CONTRIBUTING.md and can be resumed in the following two concepts:
    1: For small bug fixes, create a fork and submit a pull request.
    2: For major changes, contact the team before doing anything.
    There are also specific instructions for when someone desires to submit a bug report:
    -Use a clear title.
    -Provide reproduction steps.
    -Describe your environment.
    -Include a stack trace if needed.
    -If possible and not too complicated to do, add an example project.
