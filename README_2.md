Q1.
Q2. The commits are very disorganized, in fact, only a few amount of commits have a title which start with a descriptive word such as add, upadrage and restore. The rest are all very consfusing, not detailed enough, making it difficult to navigate threw and understanding the scope of the commit before analysing it further. I would say that the users generally do not follow good formatting, lowering the general quality of the repository.
Q3. The repository have some good practice format but could be improved. We can divide the issues into four categories, each as important.
-Titles: Although the issue titles are generally concise, some could be more concise.
-Versioning: Version numbers are included in the titles and are helpful for identifying affected versions and prioritizing issues, these are not always present though.
-Labels: Labels are used for categorization and prioritization, they can differentiate between bugs, enhancements, or documentation updates, and indicate their priority levels (low, medium, high), thus improving overall organization.
-Description: Comprehensive descriptions are not really present, this could e improved.
