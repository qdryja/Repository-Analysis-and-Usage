Q1.
Q2. The commits are very disorganized, in fact, only a few amount of commits have a title which start with a descriptive word such as add, upadrage and restore. The rest are all very consfusing, not detailed enough, making it difficult to navigate threw and understanding the scope of the commit before analysing it further. I would say that the users generally do not follow good formatting, lowering the general quality of the repository.
