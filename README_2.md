Q1.
Q2. The commits are very disorganized, in fact, only a few amount of commits have a title which start with a descriptive word such as add, upadrage and restore. The rest are all very consfusing, not detailed enough, making it difficult to navigate threw and understanding the scope of the commit before analysing it further. I would say that the users generally do not follow good formatting, lowering the general quality of the repository.

Q3. The repository have some good practice format but could be improved. We can divide the issues into four categories, each as important.
-Titles: Although the issue titles are generally concise, some could be more concise.
-Versioning: Version numbers are included in the titles and are helpful for identifying affected versions and prioritizing issues, these are not always present though.
-Labels: Labels are used for categorization and prioritization, they can differentiate between bugs, enhancements, or documentation updates, and indicate their priority levels (low, medium, high), thus improving overall organization.
-Description: Comprehensive descriptions are not really present, this could e improved.

Q4. Yes, there are instructions on how to contribute to Project Helidon. The main ways to contribute are through discussion, reporting issues, and submitting code that can be summarized as such:
-Discussion: Join the #helidon-users channel and participate in discussions.
-Issues: Report an issue with details such as Helidon version, application type and steps to reproduce.
-Code: To contribute to code, first sign the Oracle Contributor Agreement (OCA). Then, fork the repo, fix an issue or create one and fix it, and create a Pull Request then wait for a response or review.
Additionally, contributors should follow the Golden Rule and adhere to the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct.

Q7. The release notes for the Helidon on GitHub are typically organized in reverse chronological order, with the most recent release displayed at the top. Each release is presented as a separate entry and includes information about the release version, and notable changes or updates.
Each entry is composed with a brief description about the updates and a bullet list with specific changes. 

By organizing the release notes in this manner, users can easily navigate through the different versions of the Helidon, understand the changes made in each release, and assess the impact of those changes on their projects. Moreover, for sake of readability, every component of this bullet list is structured as follows:
